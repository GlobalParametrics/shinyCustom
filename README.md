# shinyCustom

This package is under development.  The aim is to automate, to some extent, the creation of custom objects (mostly input) for the RStudio's Shiny framework.

To see an example, try:

```
install.packages("htmltools")
shiny::runGithub("homerhanumat/shinyCustom", subdir = "examples/shinyapp",
                 display.mode = "showcase")
```
